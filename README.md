This project uses deep learning to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, using computer vision techniques. The model is trained using TensorFlow and OpenCV, and the final classifier is capable of real-time mask detection through webcam input.

Features : 

- Real-time face mask detection using webcam
- Uses Haar cascades for face detection
- CNN model for binary classification (Mask / No Mask)
- Simple preprocessing pipeline (resizing, normalization)
